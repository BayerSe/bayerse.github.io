Estimating a regression framework for the ES stand-alone is infeasible, and thus, our tests are based on a joint regression for the Value at Risk and the ES, which allows for different test specifications. These ES backtests are the first which solely backtest the ES in the sense that they only require ES forecasts as input parameters. As the tests are potentially subject to model misspecification, we provide asymptotic theory under misspecification for the underlying joint regression. We find that employing a misspecification robust covariance estimator substantially improves the tests' performance. We compare our backtests to existing approaches and find that our tests outperform the competitors throughout all considered simulations. In an empirical illustration, we apply our backtests to ES forecasts for 200 stocks of the S\u0026P 500 index.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Regression Based Expected Shortfall Backtesting","type":"publication"}]
